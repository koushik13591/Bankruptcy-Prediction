# Bankruptcy-Prediction

In this project, I explored the American Bankruptcy dataset, starting with data cleaning and feature engineering. I renamed columns for better clarity and handled missing values and duplicates. I then visualized the data using pair plots and heatmaps to identify relationships between features. For model building, I tried several algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and AdaBoost. I performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for better accuracy. After evaluating the models using classification reports and accuracy, XGBoost turned out to be the best model, delivering the highest accuracy and overall performance for predicting bankruptcy.
